    <h1>Chapter 93: The Morning Sunlight</h1>
    <p>
      By the morning sunlight. and the night when it falls still! Your Lord has
      not abandoned you, nor has He become hateful 'of you'. And the next life
      is certainly far better for you than this one. And 'surely' your Lord will
      give so much to you that you will be pleased. Did he not find you as an
      orphan then sheltered you? Did He not find you unguided then guided you?
      And did He not find you needy then satisied your needs? So do not oppress
      the orphan, nor repulse the beggar. And proclaim the blessings of your
      Lord.
